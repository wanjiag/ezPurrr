ezPurrr is a facilitating package for
[purrr](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/). It has straightforward `sample()`
functions to sampling from a *nested* data set (with a list column for
the data). It can also easily `broadcast()` a written function to all
other rows of the data set (all data groups).

## Installation

You can install the development version of ezPurrr like so:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes") # if not previously installed
remotes::install_github("wanjiag/ezPurrr")
```

## Example

<!-- Provide a very basic example of one function here -->

## Vignette

For more in-depth examples, please see the [full
documentation](https://wanjiag.github.io/ezPurrr/index.html) and the
